30 PARADISE LOST, B. VH.

Of light by far the greater part he took,
Transplanted From her eloudy shrine3 and placui
ln the sun's orb, made poi-ons to receive

An drink the liquid liglm finn ιο retain

Her gather'd benna, great palaez now os light.
Hither, as to their sountain, other stam
Repairing, in their golden urus druw light,
And hence the morning-planat gilde her horum
By tinctura or reflectiou they augment

Their small peculim, though from human sight
So sar remote, with diminution seen·

First in liis east the glorious lamp was seen.
Regmt ofday! und all the' horizon round
luvested with bright mys, jucund ιο run
His longitude through heuven's high rond ; the gray
Dflwn and the Pleindes before him dnnc’d,
Shedding sweet influenee: lea bright the moon,
But opposite in levell’d west was m,
liis minor, with full fiee λοι-κονίης her light
From him; sm· other light she needed none
ln that aspect, and still that distance keeps
Tm usghU then in the 2³⁸: κη mm she amnes
Revolv'd on heaven's great axle, and her reign
With thousand lesser ligi-ts dividua] holds,

With mousand thousand stura, that then appe-ru]
Spangling the hemisphere: then iim adorn'd

With their briglu luminu-ies that set and rose.

Glari evming and gluti mom crown’d tho fourth day
