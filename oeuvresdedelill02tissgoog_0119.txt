108 PARADISE LOST, Β. ΙΧ.

To sit indulgent, and with him partake
Rural repeat ς pez-mining him the while

Ἰ Veninl diaconi-se unblam'd. 1 now must chnnge

Those notes to·2r=gic; foul disti-nst, and brenel}
Disloyal on the part of man, revolt,
And disobedience .- on the part of lleaven
Now aliemued, distance and distante,
Anger and just rebuke, :nd judgmenz given,
That brought into this world a world of νυοῦ,
Sin and her shadow death, und misen-y,

Not less bu! more heroic than the mth
Of stem Achilles on his foe pursued
Thriee fugitive abo-n Troy-uam or nge
Of Turnus for Lavinia disespous'dz
Or Neptune’s ire, or Juno’s, that so long
Perplex'd the Greek, and Cytherea’s som

Of my celestini patroness, who deigns
Her nightly visimtion unimplor’d,
And dictatas ιο me slumberiug3 or inspires

Since first this subject for heroic song
Pleas'd me long chuosing, and beginning late:
Not sedulous by nature te indite “
Wars, hitherto the only argument

“ Heroic deem'd; chief master-y ιο dissent
With long md vodinus hum: fnbled knighu
In butum feign’ch the better fortitude
