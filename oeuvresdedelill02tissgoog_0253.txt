Of public :com z he wonder'd, but not long
Had laisum , wonder-ing nt himself now ποι-ες
His vinage drawn he felt to sitm-p end spate:
His arms dung ιο hie rihs3 his legs entwining
Each other, tiu supplantet! down he fell,

Α monstrem sei-pem on his belly prone,
Relucnnt, but in ναίεις n greater power

Now rul’d him, punish’d in the nimpe he dnu'd,
According ω hia duom z he would hue spoke,
But hies for hiza return'd with forked tangue
To forked longae: for now were 111 trnmform'd
Alike, ιο serpente ι11, ιε :commi-ies

To hi: bold riou dreadful was the diu

Of hissing through the all, thick swanning now
With complioaved monetent head and tau,
Sem-pion, aud ΛΞΡ, and Amphiebaena dire,
Cenum hom’d, Hydrus, and Elops drear,

And Dipsus3 (unz so thick swum'd once the soil
Redi-opt with blood of Gorgon, or the isle
Ophiusa) but nil! grenmt he :he mida,

Now dragon grown, lai-ger than whom the um
1ngender'd in the Pythian vule or slime,

Euge Pythom und his power no less he seem'd
Above the rest still to retain. They all '

Where au yet lest os that revolted tout,

Sublime with expecutiou, when ιο see
