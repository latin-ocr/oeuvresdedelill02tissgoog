80 PARADISE LOST, Β. Vlll.
Planted with walks, and howel-⁵3 thaz what I saw
Of earth before senece pleasant seem'd. Επεὶ· πω,
landen with sairest fruit that hung ιο the' eye
Tempting, stiff'd in me sudden appetite

To pluek aud eat z whereat 1wuk'd, und found
Before mine eyes all real, us the dream

lind lively shadow’d. Here had new begun

My wmdering, had not he, who was my gulde
Up himer, from among the trees appear’d,
Premente divine! rejoicing, but with nwe,

ln adontion ιι his feet 1 rell

Submiss-

. flerenr’d me, and, ι whom thou sought'st, 1 am,-
Said madly, ι author of all this thou* ww
Above, οι- round about thee, or ben-mh.

This parndise 1 give thee, count it thiue

To till and keep, and of the fruit ω ent ε

Of every trec ιὶιιι in the garden grows

Eat sreely with glad hen-23 fear here no demi: z
But or the τηε whose operation brings
Knowledge of good and ill, whichl have eet
The pledge os thy obedienee und thy nith,
Amid the garden by the tree os life,
Reme-uber what l warn thee, shun ιο uste.
And shun the hitter consequence ε for know,
The day thou eat'st thereos, my sole command
Tnnsgress'd, inevimbly finon shalz die:

From that day mol-uh md this happy stne
