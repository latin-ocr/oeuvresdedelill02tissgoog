130 PARADISE LOST, B. ΙΧ.

With meet ausoere compostum thus repned :

ι Offspring of heaven and earth, and all eunh's lord!
Thac such an enemy we have, who sech

Our ruin, both by thee inromfd 1 lenm,

- And from the parting angel over-heard,

As in a shady nookl stood behind,

Just zheu retunsa ut shut os eveuing ssowers.

But, that thou shouldst my finnness therefore doubt
To God or thee, because we have a foe

May tempt it, l expected not ω henr.

His violence thou fem-'st not, being sud·

As we ( not capable of death or puin )

Can eizher not receive, or mn repel.

His fraud is then thy sear,- wich plain infers

Thy equal sear, thu my firm saith md love

Can hy his fraud be shaken or seduc'd ς

Thoughts, which how found they harbour in thy bmst,
Adam, mis-thought of her to thee m dem- ? ι

To whom with hoeling words Adam replied ε
α Daughter of God und man, immortal Eve Ξ
For such thou uzz from sin and blame entire =
Not diffident of thee do 1 dissmde
Thy absence from my sight, but ω avoid
'she' mempt mels, intended by our foe,
For he who tempu, though in vnin, no. least aspersas
