Branching so broad md long, that in the ground
The hended twigs take root, and daughters grew
About the mother trec, a pillar’d slmde

Shelters in conl, and temls his pasturing herds

Thus fenea, and, as they thought, their shame in pan
Cover’d, but not at rest ur ease of mind,

Rain'd ut their eyes, huz high winds worse within
Began to risa, high piissimas, anger, hate,
Mittunt, suspicion, discor-1¹13 and shook sore
Their imur-d aute of mind, (xlm region «moe
And full of peuce, now vost and turbulam :
