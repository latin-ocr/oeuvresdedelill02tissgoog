290 PARADISE LOST, B. xi.

Made one with me, asl with thee nm one. -
To whom the Fnther, without cloud, uerene:
ι All thy requaet for man, accepted son,
Obuin: all thy request was my doci-ee.
But, longei- in that paradise in dwess,
The law! grave ιο nature him forbids:
Those pure imnum-ul elementa, that know
No grem, no unharmonious mixture foul,
Ejeet him, tainted now; and purge him off,
As u distemper, grass, ω nir us grusz,
And merul foed, ns may dispose him best
For dissolution wroughi by sin ; that first
Distemper*d all things, and of incorr-:pt
Corrupto-i, 1, nt first, with two sair gists
Createtl him endow'd; with happiness-⁴³,
And immortplity ι thaz fondly lost,
This other serv'd but to etan-ize ποες
'rin 1 provided death: so daath becomes
His final remedy; and (nster [iffi
Tried iu shzrp tribuhfiom and reflu’d
By saith und faithful *ιω-Μὴ ιο second lise,
Wnk’d iu thz reuuvation of the just,
Besigns him up with heaven und earth renew'd. -
But let us eall to synod all the blest,
μ Through heaven'swide bouuds : from them 1 will not hide
My judgmems; how with mankind l proeeed,
As how with peomnt angels lane they saw;
And in their state, though firm, stood more confirm'd. ι
He ended, and the Son gave signal high
