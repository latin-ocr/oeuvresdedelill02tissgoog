36⁴ PARADlSE LOST, Β. ΧΙΙ.

llis outwurd fre-adnm ε tyranny must 1:25

Yet semianimes mtions will decline so low
From virtue, (which is reason) that nu wrong,
But justice, and some sacal curse mex'd,

Still tend frum bad to worse ς till God at last,
Wessied with their iniquitiae, withdraw
His presenoe from among them, and aver-t

While yet the patriarch liv'd, who ‘smp’d the ssood,
As to forsake the living God, and sall
To worship their own work in wood and stone
For gods! Yet him God the Most High vouchsases
To call hy vision, from his saher's house,
uis kindred, and salse gods, into u land
Which he will show him ς and from him will raise
