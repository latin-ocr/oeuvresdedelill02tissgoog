Conversion and rzpentanee, us ω sonls

ln prison, under judgments imminent:

But all in vain! Which when he saw, he eoas'd

Contending, and remov'd his cents fin· off :

Then, from the mountain hewing 'imber tall,

Began ιο build a vessel os huge buuq

Measqr'd by cubit, length, and hmdth, md {niglam

Smear'd round with pitdu md ‘m the »idn a door

For man and beust: when lu, ι wonder stt-unge!

Os every beast, and bird, and insece small,

Came sevens, znd pnirs. md enter‘d iu, ns thught

Their order: last, the sire and his mreelsons,

With their four wives; aud God :nude fast the door.
Meanwhile the south-wind rose, and, with blacl: wings

Wide-hovering, nu the clouds together drove

From under heavem the hius ιο their supply

Sent up amah-u and now the thicken'rl sky

Like a dark ceiling smoth down rush'd the rain

No mare was seen: the floating vessel swum

Uplisted, and secure with beakad prow

Flood overwhelm'd, and them with all their pomp

Deep under water roll'd; sea cover'd sea,

Sea without dun-03 and in their palates,

When-¹: luxury lue reign'd, sen-monsters whelp'd
