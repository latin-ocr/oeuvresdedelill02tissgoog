3⁶0 PARADISE'LOST, B. xn.

Os briek, and os that nuff, they cast to build

A city and lower, whose top mny rench to heaven ;
And get themselves a namez lest, sar dispersed
In foreign lands, their memory be lost5
Regardless whether good or evil fame.

But God (who oft descends ω visit men
Unseen, md through their habim-aiom wnlks

To mark their doiugs), thum beholding soon,
Comes down to see their dty, ere vhe tower
Obstruct heaven-twa„ md in derision ms
Upon their tongues ι various spirit, ιο nze
Quite out their native lunguage; and, instead,
To saw a jangliug Ποία of words unknown.
Forthwith a hideous gabhle rises loud

Among the builders: euch to other calls

No! unda-stou& till hom-se, and all in tage,

As mock'd they norm: great laughter was in heaven,
And lunking down, ιο see the hubbuh strange,
And hear the din : thus was the building 1εὴ

Wherem thus Adam, tucherly displeas'd ι

Above his brethrem to himself assuming
