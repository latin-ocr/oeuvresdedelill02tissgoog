The great delivennee by her seed to come
(For hy the Woman’s Seed) on all mankind ε

Both in one faith unanimous, though aad,
With muse sor evils past3 yet much more eheer'd
With meditation on the happy end. ι

He ended, and they both descend the hill.
Desecnded, Adam to the bower, where Eve v

And thus with words not sad she him reoeiv'd. —-
