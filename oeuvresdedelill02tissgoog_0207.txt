195 PARADISE LOST‚> B. lx,
For undenum-{ing rul'd not, and the will
Hem-d not her lore = both in subjection now
To sensuul appetite, who from beneath
Usurping over sovruu reason claim¹d
Superior sway.

From thus distemper¹d hreast,
Adam, estrang'd in look und alter'd style,
Speoch intermittet! thus m Eve renew'dz

ι Would thou hndst henrken'd to my words, und §mid
With me, ns 1 boeought thee, when thnt strange
Dasire of wandel-ing, this uuhappy mom,
1 know not whence possess’d them we had then
Remaiu'd still happyq not, as now, despnil'd
Of au our gond3 shzm’d, uaked, misemble ,Ι
Ιιη noue henceforth seek needloes cause ω’ approve
The raith they owe; when eamestly they seek
Such preest} conclude, they than begin to fau. ι»

To whom, mou mov'd with touch of blame, thus Eve:
ι What words have pus'd thy lips, Adam severe!
lmpuvst thou that ιο my defanlt, or will
Of wandering, as thou call'st it, which who knows
But might ns ill have happen'd thou being by,
Or to thyself perhaps? hadst thou been there,
Or here the attempt, thou muldst not have discern‘d
Fruud in the serpent, speaking as he spake ;
No gro-md of emnizy between us known,
Why he should mean me ill, or seek ω han-m>
Was 1 ω’ huve never parted from thy side?
