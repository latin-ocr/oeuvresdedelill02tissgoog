156 PARADJSE LOST, Β. lx.

So ulrd the spirited aly snake, md Eva,
Yet more amn’d, immi-y thu repliod:

ι Serpem„ thy nverpraising leam in doubt
The virtue os that fruit, in thee first prov'd z
But say, where grows the trec? from hence how far?
For many are dne trees os God that grew
ln pnradise, and various, yet unknown ι
Tu us3 in sudi abundanoe lies our choico,

Aa leaves a greater snare of fruit umouch'd,
Still hunging incorruptible, till men

Grow up ιο their provisioni, and more hands
Heip ω disbunien nature of her hinnu. υ

Tu whom the vrily addet, blm-e md ghdz
ι Emptas. the way is ready, and not long;
Beyond a row ofmyrtles, on ι flat,

Fut hy ι sounmin, one small thicket put
Os blowing myrrh aud balm ε if thou accept
’ My oonduct, l cm bring thee thither soon. ι-

ι Lead then, uid Eva. ι fle, leading, ewiffly rnll'd
In angles, md uude intricate seem straight.
'1¹0 mischief swift. Hope elevata, und joy
Brighoemhis erest: ns when n wanden-ing fite,
Gompact of unctuous vapour, which the night
Cominus& and the oold environ-³ round,
Kindled through agitationi to a flama,
Which ost, they say, some evil spirit amends,
Hom-ing and Mazing with delusive light,
Mislmds ἀπ’ amaz’d night-wanderer from his way .
