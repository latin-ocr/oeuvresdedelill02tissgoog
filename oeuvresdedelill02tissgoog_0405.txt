391 PARADISE LOST, B. ΧΙΙ.

With inward consolatione recompamd,

And nst supporued w as shall nmaze

Their proudest persecutore z sor the Spirit
(Pom-'tl first on his apostles, whom lie sends

To' evangelize the nations, theu on all

Bapfis'd) shall them with wondrous gists endan,
To speak ull tongues, und do all miracles,

As did their Lord before them. Thus they win
Great numbers of each nation, ω receive
Withjoy the tidings brought from huven : at length
Their minian-y perform'd, and noe well run,
Their doctrine and their story written lest,

They dim but in their room, as they sorewarn,
Wolves shall succeed for tenebere, grievous wolves,
Who 1111 the sacred mysteri-s of heaven

To their own vile advanmges slull tum

Of lucre and ambitium and the tuith,

With superstitious aml traditions taint,

Left only in mose written reem-ds pure, ⁴

'though not but by the Spirit understood.

Then shall tlmy seek ιο· avnil themselves ofuumes,
Places, und titlesy and with these to join

Secular powerz though seigning still to act

By spiritiul, to themselves appropi-lating

The Spirit of God, promis'd alike aud given

To all believers: and, from that pretence,
Spiritunl laws by cun-ml power shall force

On every conscience: laws which none shall find
ωι alm„ inrolffl, or wlm the Spirie „imin
