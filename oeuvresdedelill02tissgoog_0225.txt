212 PARADISE LOST, B. X.

However insuppomble, be all
Devoh'dz though should L hold my peuce, yet thou
Wouldst easily det-zet whatl conoul.-
This woman, whom thou mad'st to be my help,
And gav'st me aa thy perfect gift, so good,
So fit, so acceptable, so divine,
Thac from her hand l could smpecz no ill,
And what she did, whatever in iuelf,
fler doing seem'd to justisy the deed;
She guve me os the trae, and 1 did ut. ι

To whom the wv'mn presence thus replied :
ι Was she thy Gud, that her thou didsz obey
Before his voice? or was she made thy guido,
Superior, or but equal, that ιο her
Thou didaz resign thy manheod, and the place
Wherein Gud set thee’ above her, made of thee,
And for thee, whose peffoeziou sar exoell'd
flers in nn real dignity? Adorn'd ,
Slm wax-indeed, and lovaiy, ιο amant
Thy love, not thy subjectiom und her gifls
Were such, ns under govermnem wess seem'th
Unseemly ιο bear rule; which was thy part
And person, hadsc thou known thyselsaright. ›-

So having said, he thus to Eve in few :
α Say woman, what is this which thou has! done? ›-
To whom sad Eve, with shame nigh overwhelm’d,
Consessing soon, yet fun before her judgss
