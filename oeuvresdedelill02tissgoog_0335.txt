324 PARADISE LOST, B. XI.

Adam could not, but περι,
Though nol. os woman bom ς compassion quell‘d
His best of uum, and gave him up ιο nean
Δ space, till firmer thoughts restrain’d exeam
And, marce recovering words, his plaint renew'd:
ι ο miseram mankind! ιο what rau ’
Βεςηάεά, ιο what wretched snte reeerv'd!
Batm- md here unbem. Why is life given
To he thus wresoed from us? rather, why
Obtruded on us thus? who, if we knew
What we receive, would either not accept
[ise offer'd, or soon beg ιο hy it domu
Glad to he so dismiss'd in peace. Can thus
The’ image os God in man, created once
So guodly and erent, though faulty since,
To such unsighzly suffen-ingan be debas'd
Under inhumm puina! Why should not man,
Remini-:g still divine similitude
ln part, from such dorm-mitia be free,
And, sor his Maker’s image suke, exempt? ι

ι Their Maker’s image ( answer'd nich-el) then

Forsook them, when themselves they vilified
To serve ungovem'd ψρειίιες and took
ffinimage whom they serv'd, a brutish vice.
Inductive mainly ιο the sin of Eve-
Theresore ιο abjectis their punishment,
Disflguring not God's likenem, but their own ;
Or is his likeness, by themselves deffic‘d3
