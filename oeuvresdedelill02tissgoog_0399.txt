388 PARADISE LOST. B. ΧΠ.
Ιπιριιιοά, heconms theirs by saith; his inei-its
To save them, not their own (though legul) voi-ks.
For this he shall live hated, be blasphem'd,
Seiz'd on hy force, judg’d, and ιο death enudemn’d,
A §hames-il and accus-§Q nail'd to the crosa
By his own uation ς shin sor bringing lise:
But to the crass he nails thy enemim:y
The law that is against thee, and the sius
Of all mankind, with him there crunified,
Never ιο hin-t them more who rightly trust
ln this his satisfaction.

So he dies,
But soon rev-iven death over him no power
Shau long usurp; ere the third dawning light
Reium, the amre ofmorn shall soe him τίκ
Out of his grue, fresh ns the dnwning light,
Thy nusum paid, which man from death redeemn,
ffis death for man, as many* us offex-’d life
Neglect not, md the heuefit ambr-ce
By saith not void of wei-ks: this god-like not
Annuls thy duom, the death thou should& have died,
In sin for ever lost from life3 this act
Shell bruise the head of Satan, crush his strength,
Defuning sin find death, his two main ιπηες
And fix far deeper in his head their stings,
Thau temporal death shall hruise the victor’s heel,
Οι- theim whom he redeam„ a death, like sleep,
Α gentle vuffing ιο immun-l life.
Nor after resurrection shall he ειη
