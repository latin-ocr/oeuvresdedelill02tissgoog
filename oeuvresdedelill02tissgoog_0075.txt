Or bvlghx infun ιιοι excellenoe = the arth
(Though in comp-rison of heaven, so arn-ll,

More plenty than the sun that barren shines3

But in the fruitful εει-ὡς 'here fust reoeiv'd,
His boam, umctive else their vigem- find.
Yet not ω earth are those bright luminaria
0ffiduus; but ιο thee, urth’s habitunt.

And for the huven's vide circuit, let it spe-k
Tha Maker's high magnifieenoe, who built

So spmious, ami his line stt-eteh'd out so fun-3
Tum man mxay know he dwells not iu his own ς
An edifica too large for him to fill,

Ordain'd for unes ιο his loni best known.
The μήθ-ιω uf those circla attribute,
Though numberlmn, ω his 0mnipooence,
