392 PARADISE LOST, B. ΧΠ.
So spake the¹ arch-angel Miehnelz then pus'd,
As at the world's grat period: and our sire,
Replete with joy antl wonder, thus replied:
ι O Goodnffl infinite, Gooduess immense l*
That all this good of evi! shall produce,
And evil tum ιο good5 more wonderful
Thau that which by crealiou first brought forth
Lighz οιιι of darkness! Full ofdouht 1 stand,
whether 1 should repent me now of sin
By me done, and occasion '3d or rejoioe
Much more, that much more good thereofshall spring;
To Gotl more glory, more good- -will to mm
From God, and over wrath grace shall abeund!
But say, if our Deliverer up ιο heaveh
Must re-ascend‚ velut will betide the few
His faithful, lest among the* unsaithful herd,
The enemies of truth? Who then shall gulde
llis people, who defend? Will they not deal
Worse with his foll->wem than with him they dealt 1· »
ι Be sure thoy will (nial the angel ), hut from heavm
fle ιο his own n comforver will send,
'she promise of the Fater, who shall dwell
ffis Spirit within them: and the law of fnith,
Working through love, upon their hum shall write,
To guida them in au truth3 and also nnn
With spiritual annunt, able to resist
smn's essaults, aml quench his liery dart-⁸5
What man can do against them, noz afraid,
Though ιο the ἀεικὴς against such eruplties
