10 PARADISE LOST, Β. vu.
Mov'd ιΙιε Cre-mr, in his hely rest

’ Thi-nugi: all eaeruity, so 1-oe to buil-1

ln chaun md the work began, how suun
Abolv'd': isunforbid thou may'st unfold
Whnt we, not-to explere the seez-ets ask
Of his eterna! empire, hut the mure

Tu magnif! his voi-ks, the more we know.

«And the great light osday yet *ants ιο run
much ofhia nee though ειεφς suzpense in heaven,
neld hy thy voice, thy potent voioe, he hears,
And longer will delay ιο hear thee tell

’ flia generation, ami the rising birth

Os nature stom the umppnrent deep:

01· if the stur of evening and the moon

Haste to thy andienne, night with her will bring ,
Silence; and deep, listening m thee, will watch :
01- πε cun bid his absence, til! thy song

End, and dismins thee ere the morning shiue. ι

Thus Adam his illustrium guest besoughl;
And tim„ 'che godaim ηιμ] „mem mna:
α This also thy tequea, with cantion nsk’d,
Obuim though ιο recount almighty works
What words or tangue o( ser-aph eun suffice,
Or henr! osmnn suffice to comprehend?
Yet what thou cansz anain, which hest may serve
