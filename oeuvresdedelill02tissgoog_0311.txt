³00 PARADISE LOST, Β. XI.

So spake, ao wisla’d much-humbled Eve3 hut fate
Subwrib'd not : nature §im gave signs, impraes’d
On bird, beust, ain air suddenly eclips‘d,

Aster short blush osmer-115 nigh in her sight
Tha hird of Jove, stoop'd from his aery tour,
Two hiras of ἕψει plume before him ἀπαγὲς
Down from n hill the beast that reigns ἰιι ποοὼ,
First humer theu, pursued a gentle brace,
Goodliest of nu the forest, hart md hind;
Diu-eet to the' eastern gam was hem their ssight.
Adam observ'd, md with his eye the dnm
Pursuing, not unmov'd, ῑο Eve thu· spnke :

a 0 Eve, some further change παίω us nigh
Which Haaven, by these mute signs in nature, shows
Forerunners os his purpose; ur to wurn
Us, haply too secure, os our discharge
From penalty, because from death rehns'd
Some days : how long, and what till then our lise,
who kuows? οι· more than this, -- mat we are duat,
And thither must return, and be no mon-e?

Why else this double object in our sight

or ssight μιῇ-αι in the air, and «ser 2112 ground,
One way the sels-same honr? why in the east
narkness ere day’s mid-course, and morning-light
More oriem in yon western cloud, that ἀνῆψε
