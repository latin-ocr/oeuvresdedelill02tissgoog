³70 PARADISE LOST, Β. xn.

And 211 his peopl„ munder mix’d with 11⁸ss,
nail— mix'd with fin, must rond the Egyptian skyy

And wheel on the earth, demun-ing where ix rolin

What it devours not, herb, or fruit, or guin,
Α dnksome cloud os locusta swarming down

Must eat, and on the ground leuve nothing gran:

Darknesu must overshndow ull his bounds,
Pulpnbloe darkness, and blot out three days:
hut, with one midnight-stroke, all the first-bom
Of Egypt munt lie dmd.

ι Thus with ten wounds
The river-dragon mn'd at length, submits
To let his wjoumers ἅψαι-ι, and oft
Humbles his stuhbom hem-u hut still, as ice
More hasden’d aster thum till, in his nge
Pmuing whom he late dismiss'd, the sea
Swauows him with his host3 but them lew pass,
