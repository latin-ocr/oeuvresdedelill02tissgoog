Of hem-sich ngony, ull favemus kinds,

Intestine stone and ulcer, odic-punga,
Demonine phronzy, ,παρίης molnmzholy,

And moon-struck madum, pining atmphy,

Dropsies, and mhmas, md joint making rheuma.

Tenfled the siclty busiest from coueh ῑο coueh;
And over them triumphant death his dart
Shook, but delay’d to strike, though oft invuk‘d
With γῦπε, ns :hair chief good, md final hope.
