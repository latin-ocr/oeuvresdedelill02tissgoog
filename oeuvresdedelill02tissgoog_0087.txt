76 PARADISE LOST, B. Vlll.
Str-night mward heaven πῃ wondering eyes Ι tum’d,
And guz'd a while the ample sky ι till, rnis'd

By quick instinctive motion, up l sprung,

A, thither-ward endeavouring, and upright

stood on my feet: about me mund 1 saw

niu, dnle, and shndy woods, and sunuy phins,
And liquid lapse of murmuring utrenms5 by these,
Creazures that liv'd und mov'd aud wnlk'd, or ssew3
nin-ds on the branchos warbliugz all things smil'd ι
With fngmnee md with joy my hem-t o’erflow'd,
Myself 1 then pems'd, und limb hy limb

Survey'd, und sometimes wem, and sometimes ran
th supple joints, us lively vigum· led z

But who 1 was, or where, or from what cause,
Knew nnn to speak 1 tried, und forthwizh spake3
My mngue obey'd, and readily oould nume
Whnte’er 1 saw. Thou sun, (uid 1) ἰώ· light, s
And thou eulightewd ean-thy se fresh and ΕΠ, .
Ye hius, and dales, γε rivers, woods, md plnins,
And γε that live tud move, sair creatura, tell,
Tell, is γε saw, huwl came thus, huwe here?

Not ofmyselsz - hy some grem Maker them*
ln goodnaes und in power pre-amineum
