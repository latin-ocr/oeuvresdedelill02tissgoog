16 PARADlSE LOST, Β. vn.

To act or nou neeussity und chmoe
Appi-uach not me, and what 1 will in fite. n
So spake ὼε Almighty, und to what he spnke
His word, the filiai godhead, gave effect.
hnmediate are the acts os God, more swift
Thau time or motiouz but to hum-n ears
Cauno: without process of speech be told,
So told as eanhly notion ean receive,
Great triumph md rejoiciug was in heaven,
When such was haar-i declar’d the* Almighty's will:
«Glory, they sung, to the Most High! good will
To future men, and iu their dweninga peace!
Glory m him, whosejust avenging ire
Had driven out the’ uugodly from his sight
And the* habitations of the just; to him
Glory and praise! whose wiffldom had ordain'd
Good out os evil ιο create; instead
Of spirits malign, a better tace to bring
luto their vanam mom, and thence diffuse
His good to ποι-Ιώ md ages infinite. -

Ofmujesty divine z sapienee and love
Immense, and all his Fathm· in him shone.
About his chax-iot numberless were pour'd
Cherub and seraph, potentates and durana,
And virtues, winged spirits, and ehu-ints wing'd
