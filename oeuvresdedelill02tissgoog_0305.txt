291 PARADISE LOST, B. XI.

ι nich-el, this my heheu have thou in charge ;
Take ιο free from nmong the chen-:ibim
Thy choioe os flnming wnrrinrs, lest the flend,
Or in behals os man, or to invade
Vanam possession, some new trouble nise :
Haste thee, and from the paradise of God
Without remorse drive out the sinful paim
From hallow'd ground thel uuholy; and denmmce
To them, and to their progeny, from thence
Perpetual hanishmem* Yet, leet they faint
Αι the sad sentence rigorously urg'd,
. (Forl behold them sosten'd, aud with tem-s
Bewniling their excess,) all terror hide.
15 paziemly thy bidding they uhey,
Dismiss them uo: disconsolameg reveni
Tu Adam what 5111111 come in future days,
As 1 shall thee enlightem intermix
My covenaut iu the wumnn's seed renew'd;
So send them forth, though son-owing, yet in peace:
And on the east side os the guden place,
Where entrance up from Eden easiest climbs,
Cherubie watch ; and us a sword the fleme
wide-waving: all approach far off to ffight,
And guard n'l! passage tu the :ree oflise:
Les! paradise a receptucle prove
To spin'ts foul, und all my trees their prey;
With whose stol'n fruit man once more ιο delude. υ
He ceas'd ς and the arch-angelic power prepu’d
For swist descenu with him the eohorz bright
