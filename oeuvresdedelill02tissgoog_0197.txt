18⁶ PARADISE LOST, Β. ΙΧ.
Againflt his better kuowledgm not deociv'd,
But fondly oven-come with female dum.
Eun-th trembled from her entrails, aa again

Wept at eompleting of the mon-ul sin

Much pla-‚sure we have lost, while we abstain’d
From this delightful fruit, nor known till now
True relish, tasting: if such pleasure be
