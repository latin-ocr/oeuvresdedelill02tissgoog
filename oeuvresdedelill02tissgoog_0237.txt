So if grat things to small may be eompar’d,

From Susa, his Memnoninn pul-ce high,

Bridglng his ny, Europe wilh Asin join’d,

And scourg'd with many a stroke the indignant vave}-

Now had they brought the work hy wondrmu un

Over the vex'd abyss, following the track
Of Sanan to the sels-sume place where be
Firnt lighted stom his πίῃς, und hnded nse

Of this round world ι with pins of adamam
And clusum they made all rm,- too fast they made
And dun-able Ε und now ίιι little space
The confines met of empyrean heaven,
And uf this world3 and, on the lest hand, hell
With long resch iuterpoe’dq thren several ways
