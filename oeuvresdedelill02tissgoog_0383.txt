372 PARAmSE LOST, B. ΧΙῙ.
As on dry land, between two crysul wnl!s;
Aw'd hy the rod of Moses so ω sunt!
nivi-iad, till his rescued gain their shore.

Such *sundram power God tofis saint will len-d,
Thou-gh present in his angeh who shall go
Before 'hem in a cloud, und pill'ar of fite ι

By day a cloud, by night a pillar bs Επες

To guide thern in their journey, and remove
Behiud them, while the' obdurate king pur-sues :
Au night he will pureum but his approach
Dux-knew defends between till morning wudu
Then through the fleu-y pillnr, and the cloud,
God lacking sort}- will trouble all his host,

Ami craze their chax-iot 'hanla = whtm by command
Moses unce more his potent rod extends

Over the sea: the sea hi.- rod obeys3

0n their embmled ranks the waves return,
And overwhelm their war z the mee elect

Sal'e munds emam stom the shore advance
Through [he wild desan, not the readiesc ,πῃ
Last entering on [he Gauzania alnrm’d,

Wnr ten-isy them inexpert, ond sear

Renum them back ιο Εὲῃκ, choosing rather
Ingloriom lise with sen-vitudu for lise

To noble and ignoble is more sweet
