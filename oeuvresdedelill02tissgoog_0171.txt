’ 160 PARADISE LOST, Β, lx.

As when os old some onte-r renom‘d,

ln Athens or free Rome, where eloqu-moe
Flam-ish'd, since mute, ιο some great cume address'd,
Stood in himself collecte& while each pun,

Mozion, each net, won audienee ere the tongum
Sometimes in heighth began, as no delay

Of presaoe brooking, through his καὶ of right :

So standing, moving, or ω heighth up grown,

The temptet, an impudou'd thus begua ι

ι 0 sacred, wisc, and wisdom-giving plant,
Motha· of mimae! now l feel thy power
Within me clm ε not only to disoern
Things in their causes, but to tuoe the ways
Os highest ugente, deem’d however vise*
Queen os :his universe! do not believe
Thdse rigid threats of death : γε shall not die:
How should you ?—by the fruit? it gives you lise
To knowledge ,·-by the thmteuer? look on me,
Me, who have touch’d und mted ς yet both live,
And life more perfect have :twin'd than rute
Mum me, by veuturiug higher than my lot.
Shnll thu be shut ω nun, which ω the bust
Is open? or will God incense his ire
