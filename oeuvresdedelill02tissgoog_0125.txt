Os thoughts revolv’d, hh final sentence chose
Fit venel, fluat imp offmui, in whom

To enter, und his dnrk suggestions hide
From sharpest sight : sor, in the wily snake
Whatever sleights, neme would suspicions mark,
As from his wit und native subtlezy
Procoerlinffl which, in other heum observ'd.
Douht might haget os diabolie power

Active within, beyond the seme of brute.

, Thus he ruolv'd, but first from inward grief

His bunting passion imo philus thus pour'd ε

More justly, seat worthier of gods, aa built
With second thoughts, resorming what was old ,V
For what God, after better, worse would built! 7
Terrestrial heaven, dnnc'd round hy pther henvens
Tha: shine, yet bear their bright officium hmps,
Light above light, for 'hee alone, as seems,
ln thee conventi-ing nn their preeiom henum
Of sacred lnfluenoe l As God in hmven

Genu-ing, reeeiv'st from all those orbs ι in thee,
Not in zhemelves, nll their known virtue* appears,
Productive in herb, phut, md nobler birth
Of arenburen mimate with gradu-l life
Of growth, sense, reason, all summ‘d up in ιιιιιι.
With what delight could l have wnlk'd thee round,
