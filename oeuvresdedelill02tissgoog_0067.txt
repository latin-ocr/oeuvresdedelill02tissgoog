The angel ended; and in Adam‘s ear
So charming left his voice, that he nwhile
Thought him still speaking, still stood fix'd ιο hear ;
Then, as new wak'd, thus gratefully replied:

a What thanks sufficiant, nr what recompenso
Equal, have 1 ιο render thee divine
Histoi-ian! who thus lurgely hast allay'd
The 'hirst 1 had of knowledge, and vouehsufd
This ffieudly condescensioni tn relatae
Things, else by me unsurchab1e5 now heard
With wonder, but delight‚ and, as is due,
With glory attribuved ιο the high
Creator? Something yet of doubt manaim,
Which only thy solution can resolve.
