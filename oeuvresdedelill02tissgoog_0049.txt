38 PARADISE LOST, B. Vll.

The εἰκώ, aud osca-maon lut, arose
With even-:ing ‘urps and mutin ; when God said ε
αΙ-ει the’ earth bring forth sonl living in her kind,
Canle, and creeping things, and beust os the earth,
Each in their kind. ι The emh ⁰bey'd, and straight
Opening her fenile womh teem'd ³2 a birth
lunumerous living creatures, perfect forms,
Limh’d und sul! grown z out of the ground up ruse,
As from his lair, the wild beust where be που»
ln forest wssd, ‘m thieket, brnke, or denz
Among the trees in pairs they νοιε7 they walk'd ε
The cattle in the fields and meadows green:
Those rare and solitary, these in ssocks
Pantul-ing a! once, and in broad herds upsprung.
The grassy clods now calv'd : now halsappenr'd
The mwny lion, ppwiug to gez free
His hinder parm, then springs ns broke from honds
And rampnm makes his hrinded mnne3 the ounez,
The libbard, and the ziger, as the mole
Rising, the crumbled earth above them threw
ln hillocks : the swist stag stom under ground
Bore up his branchfing head : scm-ee from his mould

nehem-nh, biggest horn os earth, upheav'd
His vnstness ε sseee'd the flocks and blenting rose,
