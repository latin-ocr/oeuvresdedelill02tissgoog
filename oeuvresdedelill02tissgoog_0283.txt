2¹12 PARADlSE LOST, B. Χ.

As join’d in injuria, une enmity

Agnimt a foe hy doom express mig-sd un,

That crue! sen-pem.- on me exon-eise not

Thy haered for this misery befnll'm

On mu already lost, me than thywlf

Mure mim-able! Both have siun'd; buz thou
Aguinsz God only: 1 nguinst Gud and theu
And ιο the place off judgment will return:
There wit'h my crim importune flavet-13 thaz all
The sentence, from thy had remov'd, my light
On me, mle muse ω thee us nl} thiu wne.

Me, me only, just object os his ire! ι

She ended weeping3 and her lowly plight
lmmo'vahle, tiu peace obtain'd from fault
Acknowledg'd md deplor'd, in Adam wroughk
Commioerafion : soon his beart relemed
Towards her, his life so law, und sole deligi-t,
Now ιιι his feet suhmiseive in ἀίω-θεας
Creature so fuir his redoneilement seeking,
llis mutual, whom she hqd displens’d, his aid:
As one dimm'd, his anger all he lost,

And thus with peaceful words uprais¹d her soon:

ι Unwary, and too desimus, as before,
So now of what thou know’st not, who dair’st
The punishment all on thyselst alas 1
Bar thine own first, ill able tu susuu'n
