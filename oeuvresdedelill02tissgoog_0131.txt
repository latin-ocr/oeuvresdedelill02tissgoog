120 PARADISE LOST, B. lx.

Ami naming mininms ιο watch md tami
Their earthly charge z os these the vigil-nee

l dread: aud, m elude, thus περι in mist
Of midnight vaponr glide obscure, and pry
ln every bush und brake, where hap may find
The serpent sleepiug; in whose mazy folds

To hide me, and the durk intent 1 bring.

-0 foul dementi that 1. who erut enntended
With gods to sit the high-st, nm now wnseruin’d
Into n beust: and, mix’d with beslial slime,

This essence to incarnata aud imbrute,
Tim ιο the heighthbos deity aspir’d!

But what will not ambicio-1 and revenge

Descend tu? Who aspires, must down as low

As high he soar'dz obnoxiuus, first οι· last‚· ,

To hnsest things. Revenge, ιι first though sweet,
Bitwr ere long, back on itsels recoils:

laet it3 1 reeh not, m it light well nim'd,

Since higher 1 tall short, οιι him who next
Provokes my -vy, this new favum-ite

Os heaven, this man ot chy, son of despite,
