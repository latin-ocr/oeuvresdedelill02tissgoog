228 PARADISE LOST, B. Χ.

And now their way ιο ιιι-ὼ they lud desen-fied,
To paradise first oendinffl when, beholdl
Satan, in likeness of an angel bright,

Betwi‘n the Centam· and the Scorpion steen-ing
His zenith, while the sun in Arios rose :
Disguis'd he ‹3an3 but [hose his children deur
Their parm! soon discern'd, though in disguise.

He, afim· Eve ssduc'd. uuminded slunk
Into the wood fast 1³55 and, changing ahape,
To' observe the sequ-el, saw his guilefnl aet
By Eve, though ιῚΙ unweeting, seconded
Upon her husband; saw their shame that songht
Vain covertures; hut when he saw descend
The Son os God to judge them, ten-ified
He fled3 nm. hoping to nempe, but §hun
The ρτειειιις feu-ing, guilty, whnt his ναι-ιώ
Might suddenly inflict: that pust, rezum‘d
By night, and listening where the hapless pair
Sat in their sad discum-se, and various plnint,
Thence gamen-’d his own doum ς which understood
Not instant, but os future time; with joy
And tidings fraught, to hell he now return'd3
And nt the hrink of chaos, near the suot
Of this new wondrous pontifice, unhop'd
Met, who ω meet him came, his offipring dur.
*Gran joy was at their meaning, and nt sight
