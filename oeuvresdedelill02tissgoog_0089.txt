78 PARADISE LOST, B. Vlll.
Tell me, how may l know him, how adm-e,
From whom l have that thus 1 move and live,
And feel that 1 am happier than 1 know. -—-

ι While thus 1 calm, and stray'd 1 knew not whither,

From where l first drew air, and first behold
This happy lighu when, ans-rer nune ηιιιι-ηἰί,
On a green uli-dy bank, profuse of nowers,
Pensive I sat me down τ there gentle sloep
First found me, and with snit oppression seiz'tl
My droa-sed sense, untroubled ε (though l thought
1 then was passing to my former state
lnwnsible, and sorthwith ιο dissolve ι )
When suddenly stood at my head a ‹ii-emm
Wlmie inward apparitiou gently mov'd
My faut-,y to believe Ι yet had being,
And liv'd ι one eume, methought, of slupe divine,
And said : ιι Thy mmsion want-s thoe, Adanu rinc,
rim man, uf m·- iunumerable nrdnin'd
First father! call'd by thee, l corne thy gulde
To the garden of hliss, thy seat prepnr'd. n

v So saying, by the haud he took me rais'd,
And over fields und κεῖθι-ε, as in uir
Smootli-slidiug without Scep, last led me up
Α wnody mountain ς whose high top was plain,
Α circuit wide, enclos'd with goodliest ιηεῦ,
