Fur God is nlso’ in ιΙεφς und dream advise,
Which he bath sent propitians, some great good

In me is nn delay ς with thee to go,

Is ιο ειη hen-ez without thee here to stay,

Art ull things unda- honvtn, 211 phou thou,
Who fon-*my wilfi-l crime art buninh'd hence.
This further consolation yet secure

I carry hence; though all vby me is lost,

Such favour] unworthy am vuuchsaff'd,

By me the promis'd Seud shall all restore. -

So spake our mother Eve; and Adam hym-d
Well plans'd, but answer’d not: fur now, ιοο nigh

To their fix'd station, all in bright trray
The cherubim descende& on ι1ιο ground

Risen from a river o'er the marish glides,

And gnthers ground fast at the labourer's hoel
Homeward returning. High in from advane'd,
The brandish'd svm-d of God before rhem blnz'd,
Fiet-ee ns n comet ς which with ton-rid beat,

And vapour u the Libyan air adun,

Began ιο pamh that tempu-ute eli-uu mserum,

Our lingering parma, md ιο the’ enuer- gno
