³5⁴2 PAnAmSE LOST,'B. ΧΙ-

With chmour thenoe the npid cun-‘rents drive,
Tonrds the recenti-:g seu, their furious tide.

Forthwith from οιιι the ark n raven ssies.
And after him the sul-er messenger,
A dove sent forth 011oe and again to spy
Green tren or ground, whereon his font may light:
The semnd time κιαι-Βίης, in his hill
An olive-lens he brings, pacific sign :
Αῑιοιι, dry ground uppem-s, md from his ark
The ancient nire timenda, with an his tuin.
Then with uplisoed hands, and eyes devant,
Grawful m Heaven, over his head beholds
Α dewy cloud, and iu the cloud n how
Conspicuous with three listed cnlours gay,
Betokening peace from God, md covennnt new.
Whereat the heart os Adam, πει so sed,
Greassy rejoie'd3 und thus his joy broke forth:

ι 0 thou, who future things φηςι represent
A» present, heavenly instructor! Ι revive
At this lut sight; assu-red thu man shall live,
With ³11 the creatum, and their seed preserve.
Far lese 1 now lamen: for one whole world
Os wicked sons destroy'd, than 1 rejoice
For one man found so perfect, and so just,
That God vouchsafes w nise mother world
From him, and all his anger to fon-get.
But say, what mean those colour'd streaks in heaven
Dis'tended, as the hrow of God appm’d'?
