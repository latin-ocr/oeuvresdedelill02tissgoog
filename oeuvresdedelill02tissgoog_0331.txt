To’ whom Miehnel thus( he also mov'd) rephaed:
ι These two are brethren, Adm, ami to come
Οιιῑ of thy loim3 the' unjust the just Ruth slahu,
For envy that his brother's offen-ing found
From heaven toeepmnee: hut the bloody fact
Will he uage& und the' οἰδα-ἰ saith, approvfll,
[οη no πεπυ-ἀ : thth here thou see him die,
Rolling in duat und gare. To which our aire.

But huvel now seen denna? 1⁸ this the way

Os terror, foul and ugly to behold,
Horrid ιο think, how horrible to see! ! n

To whom thus Miehael: ι Death thou hnst men

Osduth, and many are the ways that lead
To his grim cave, ull disnmh yet w sense
More ten'ible nt the’ entnnce, than within.

By fite, ssood, famine, hy intempernnce more
