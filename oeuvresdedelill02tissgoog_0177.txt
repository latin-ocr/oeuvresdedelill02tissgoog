lus PARADlSE LosT, n. [X.

a Great are thy virtues, doubdess, best ot fruit-s,
Thnugh kept from man, and worthy to Μ’ admir'd:
Whose une, wo long sorbome, ιι finnt ιω]
Gava alocntiuu to the mute, and taught
The tangue not-made fur *puech ιο speuk thy pnisee
Thy pmioe he also, who. fon-bida thy nse,

Coneeals not from us, naming thee the true

Of knowledge, knowledge both os good und evss;
Forbids us then ιο nasta Ξ, hut his forbidding
Commends thee more, while it infers the good
By mee communionum, and our want:

For good unknown suro in not hauh or, had
And yet unknown, is ns not had at all.

ln plain then, what sorbids he bnt ω know,
Fnrhids ns guod, for-bida un to be wize?

Such prnhihitions bind not. But, if death

Bind us with aster-bunds, what profiss then

Oun- inw-rd fraudem? lu the day we eat

Of this sair fruit, ουκ· doom is, we shall die!

How dies the serpent? he hath caten and lives,
And knowsami speaks, and reasons and discems,
lrrational tin then. For us alone

Was death invenoed? or to us dsuied
