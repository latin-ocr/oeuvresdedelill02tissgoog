100 PARADISE LOST, B. Vffl.

And to malitias yield all her shows :

Made to adum fur thy delight the more,

So awful, that with honour thou may’st love

Thy mate, who sees when thou art seen 'least wisc.

But isthe sense of touch, whereby mankind

Is propagate-i, seem such dearbdelight

Beyond all other, think the same vouchsafd -

To cnttle md weh bonu which would not be

To them made oummon and divulg'd, ifnught

By which to heavenly love thou may'st nwend,

Not suuk in ounml pleasure; for which cause,

Among the δεθείς no mave fni· thee was found. ι

Thone thousand decencies, that daily flow

From all her words and actions, mix'd with love
