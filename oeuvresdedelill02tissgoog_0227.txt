215 PARADISE LOST, Β. X.

Bold οι· loquacium, thus ahauh'd repiied:
ι The serpent me beguil'd, and l did eat. -

Which when the Lord God heard, without dehy
To judgment he proceederl on the* aecus'd
εει-μεως though brute, unable to transfer
The gunt ou him, who made hini instrument
Of mischius, and polluted from the end
this πελάσῃς jnstly then ηοω-δἐἰ,

As vitiated in mum .- more to know'

Gonoem‘d not man, (since he no further knew)
Not alten-’d his οίϊεηεες yet God at luz

To Satan, first in sin, his duom npplied,

Thongh in mysteriou's tems. judg'd ns then hest:
And on the serpent thus his curse let sall:

«ι Because thou has: done this, thou art aceurs'd

Above all cattle, each beas! of the field;

Upon thy belly gmveling thou skalt go,

And duat skalt ent au the days os thy [ise.

Between thee and the worn-n 1 will put

Enminy, and between thine and hei· πῶς

Her seed shall bruise thy head, thou bruise his heel. ι

So spake the oncle, then verified
When Jesus, son ol ΜΒΝ, second Eve,

Saw Sam fall, like lightning, down from heavu,
Prinne of the ain then, rising froin his grave,
Spoil'd principalities and powers, fflnmph'd

ln open show; und, with 'aseension brigium,
Captivity led captive through the air,

The realm inself of Sumn, long nsnrp'dz
