I find no wny, from deep ιο deeper phug'd! ι

Thus Adam ιο himself larnenved loud,
Through the still nigfflq not now (as ere man fell)
Wholesome, and coel, und mild, but with blank air
Accompagnied3 with damps und dreaful gloom;
Which ῑο his evil conscience represented
Au things with double terror : ou dhe ground
Ouzstreteh'd he luy ς on the ooln ground: and ost
Curs’d his eremium death ns ost aoem'd

Of tax-dy execution, since denoune’d
The day os his offence.

To end me? Shall trulh fail to keep her ward?

Mends not her slowest pace for prayers or eries.
0 woods, Ο smmuins, hillonks, dales, and howel-sl
with other echo latel taught your shades
To answer, and resound far other song. ,ι

Whom thus afflicted when sad Eve heheld,
Demlate where she saty approaching nigh,
Sust words ω his (ξω-(ιε panion she assay‘d :
But her with stem regu-d he thus repell'd ι
