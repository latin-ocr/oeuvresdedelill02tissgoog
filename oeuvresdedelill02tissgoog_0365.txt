³⁵⁴ PARADISE LOST, Β. n.
Or serve they, u a stowe-ry vorge, ιο bind
The fluid nkil-tn of thnt name wnery cloud,
lans! it again dissolve, and shown· the earth? ιι
To whom the arch-nngel ι ι Dextmusly thou aim’sn ;
So willingly doth God remit his ire;
Thnugh late repenting him of mm deprav’d:
Griev'd at his beart, when looking down he saw
¹ The whole arth fill'd with violence, and nll flesh
Corrupting euch their my5 yet, thooe remov'd.
Such gnae ahall nne jun man find in hia sight,
v ΤΙιιι he rehum, not ω blot out mankind:
And makes ι novenam never ιο destroy
Thu earth again hy floodz nor lez the sea
Suu-pass his bounds ; nm· nin tu drown the world,
With mnu then-ein οι· beant: but, when he brings
Over «he earth ι cloud, will thereiu set
His triple-colour'd how; when-eon ω 1ook
And eall to mind his voventum day and night,
seed-time and harvest, beat md hou-y fron,
Slull hold theh- course : till ἦτε purge all things new,
Both heaven and earm, when-ein the just shall dwell. n
