134 PARADISE LOST, B. lx.

And Eve first to her husband thus begu: =
·Adam‚ well may we hhour still to dress

This gardan, still ιο tend plant, herb, and flower,

Our pleasant mk enjoin'd; but, till more hands

Aid us, the work under our lubom- grows,

Luxurious by restraiutq what we by day

Lop overgrown, or praue, οι· prop, or bimi,

One night or two with wnmon growth derides,

'sending to wild, Tho'u therefore now advisa,

Or hear whzt ω my mind first thoughts present:

Le: ιιι divide our labom; thou, where chaine
Leads rhea, οι· where mun neonis, whether to wind
The woodbine round this αδοπτ, οι· direct

The claspiug ivy where ιο climb = while 1,

ln yonder spring of rusus intermix'd

With myrtle, find what ιο redu-ess tffl noon:

For, while so near each other thus ull day

Our task we choose, what wonder if so near
Looks iuven-vene and smiles, or object new
Casual diseourse drnw ⁰¹¹3 which invermizs

Our day's work, brought to little, though begu·-
Early, and the' hour os supper comes uneam'd'x' »
