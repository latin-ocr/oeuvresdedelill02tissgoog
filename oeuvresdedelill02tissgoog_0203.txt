192 PARADISE LOST, B. lx.

Which leuva us unked thus, of honour void,

Os innocenoe, of stiffi, ns purity,

οιιι- wanted ornaments now soil’d md suin'd,
And in our faces evident the signs

To sur or sun-light, spread their umbrage broad
And hrown as evening ι cover me, ye pines!

Smne trec, whose broad smooth laves together sew'd
And gin-ded nn our luins, may cova round
These middle parts: that this new comer, shame,
There sit not, and repro-*ach us as unclean. u

Ιηω the :hickest wood: there soon they chose
The fig-trec: not thaz kind for fruit reuomsd,
