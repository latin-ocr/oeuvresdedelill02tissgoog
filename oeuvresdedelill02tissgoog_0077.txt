1¹·ss PARADISE LOST, B. vul.

To thee who hast thy dwelling here ou earth.

God, ω remove his way from human sense,

Plac'd heaven from earth so far, thaz earzhly sight,

lf it presume, might err iu things ιοο high,

And nu advantage gain. What if the sun

Be center ιο the world3 and other aurs,

By his attractiva virtue and their own

lncized, dunee about him various romnis?

Their wanderiug course now high, now low, then hid,

Progressive, retrograde, of standing still,

ln six thou sensu and what if seventh to these

The planet earth, so stedfnst though §he seem,

Iasensibly three different motions move?

Which else ιο several spheres thou must ascribe,

Mov’d contrary with thwan obliquities3

or save the sun his labour, am] thn. swist

Noctumal and diuma! rhomb suppos’d,

Invisible dae above all stare, the wheel

Os day and night3 which needs not thy belief,

n· Earth, indu-§trinus of herself, sexch day

Travelling east, and with her part averse

From the Suffs heum meet night, her other part
' still luminous hy his ray. What if that light,

Sem from her through the wide transpicuous air,

To the terrestrialjnoon he as a star,

Eulighzeniug her by day, as she by night

This-unm Μοίρι-σω, is lund be thel-e,

Fields and inhabitants: her spon thou west,

Aa clouds, und clouds may rain, and rain produoe
