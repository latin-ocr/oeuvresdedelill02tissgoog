220 PARADISE LOST, B. Χ.

And thought not much to clothe his enemies:

Nor he their outwnrd only with the skins

Os bensts, but inward nakedness (much more ’
Oppi-obvious) with his robe of righteousness
Amying, euvei-’d from his Father's sight·

To him with swist ament he up retum'd,

Into his blissful bosom reassum'd

In gion-y, as of olda to him ¹ppeas'd,

All (though all knowing) what had pass'd with man
Remunted, mixing iuven-cessim: sven.

Meanwhile, ere thus was sinn’d andjudg'd on ean-thy
Within the ‘utos os hell nt Sin and Denda,
In counwrview within the gates, that now
Stood open wide, belching outngeous fleme
Far into chaos, since the flend pass'd through,
Sin opening ς who thus now to Death began:

ι 0 soni why sit we here, each other view-ing

ldlyy while Satan, our great author, thrives

In other worids, and happier sent provides

For us, his offspring deur? it cannot be η

Bul that success utentis Ιιίηις if mishap,

Ere this he had return'd‚ with fin-y driven

By his avengers, since no place like this

Can fit his punishment, oi· their revenge.
