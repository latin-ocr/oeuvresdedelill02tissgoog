Lougei· on earth, uum certain times ιο* appear

To his discipules, men who in his life

Still follow’d him; to them shall leave in charge
To teaeh flll natione what of him they leam'd

And his salvatiozu them who shall believe
Baptizing in the profluent stream, the sign
Ofwashing them stom guilt os sin to life

Pure, and iu mind prepar'd, isso besan,

For death, like that which the Redeemer died.

All nations they shall ιειεὶις for, from that day,
Not only ω the sons of· Abraham’s luins

Salv-tion shall be preach'd, hut to the sons

Of Abrahssm's raith wherever· through the worldz
So in his seed alt nations shall be blest-

Then ιο the heaven os heavens he shall ascend
With victory, triumphing through the air

Over his foen and thine; there slull surprise

The serpent, prinae ofnir, und drag in chains
Throngh all his renlm, und there consounded lenve;

Ahove all namen iu heaven; and thence shall come,
When this world's dissolutior· shall he ripe,

With glory' and power tu judge hoth quick and dead ς
To judge the unfaithful dead, but to reward

ffis faithful, and receive them into hliss,

Whether in heaven or earth ; sor then the earth
Shall all be paradise, sar happier place

Thau this os Edeu, aud far hnppier days. n
