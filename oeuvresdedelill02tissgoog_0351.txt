340 PARADISE LOST, Β. xl.

ι But he, the seventh from thee whom thou behdd'st
The only right-mus in a world perverse,
And therefore hated, therefore so hesel
With foes, sor during singie ιο be just,
And utter odim-s nuth, that God would come
Tu judge them with his saints: him the Most High,
napt in a balmy cloud with winged steeds,
Did (as thou saw'n) τεθείη, to walk with God
fligh in salvation md the elimes of bliss,
Exempt from deatlu ιο show thee what reward
Awaits the ganah the rest what punishmem;
Which now direct thine eyes and soon behold. ι

He look’d, und saw the sace os t'hings quite chang'd;
The bruzen throat οἰκει- had eeas'd to νοω-ς
ΛΗ now was tur-n’d to jollizy and guma,
To luxury and τίοι, feast and danoe:
Man-ying or prostituting, as befeh
Rape or adunery, where passing fair
Allur’d them: thence from (ξυμ ω civil broils.

A: length n revereat sire among them came,
And of their doings great dislike declar'd,
And testis-fied against their νηῦς he ost
Frequented their asoemblies, wheresu met,
