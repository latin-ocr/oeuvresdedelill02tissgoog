50 PARADISE LOST, B. VH.

Of haaven's high-santet! top, the' imperial throne
Of Godhead, fix’d for ever firm aud sura,

The fili-l power urriv'd, and sat him down

With his great Ful-neu for he also wem
Invisible, yet said, (such privilege

Rath Omnipresence) and the work ordain'd,
Auzhor and end of all thingau and, from work
Now meing, bless’d and hallow'd the sevenzh day,
Aa testing on that ὼγ from all hi, work,

But not in silence hely kept.

The harp
Had work and tested ιιοῑς the solemn pipe,
And dulcimer, all organa of sweet stop,
All munds on fret by string or gulden wire,
Temper'd sosz zunings, intermini with voice
Chonl or unison: of incense clouds,
Fuming from goldeu censen, hid :he mount.
Crean'on and the six days acts they sung:

α Great are thy works, Jehovahx infinite
Thy power! what thought mn measure thee, οι· tangue
aelate thee? creater now 'm thy retum
Thm from the giam angels: thee that day
Thy munden mgnified; but ιο create
1⁵ gre-ter than created to dmm-oy.
Who can impair thee, mighty king, or bound
