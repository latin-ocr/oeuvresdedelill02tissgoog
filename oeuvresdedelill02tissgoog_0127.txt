116 ι PARADISE LOST, Β. ΙΧ,

Of hin and valley, τίνει-ιζ woods, and’plains;

Now land. now aaa, and shores with forest cmvm'd,
Roclm, dens, and caves! But 1 in none os thane
Find place or resuge; and the more I see

Pleasures about me, so much more l feel

Tor-ment within me, as from the hateful siege

Of conum-ies ι all good to me becomes

Bane ‚ and in heaven much worse would be my smne.

But neither here seek I ‚ no ‚ nor in heaven

To duell, unless by mastering heaven¹s Suprema ς
Nor hope to be myself less misen-able

Β] what 1 see, hin others ιο make such

As 1, though thereby worm ιο me redound ι

For only in destroying 1 find ease

To my relemless thoughes3 and, him destroy'd,
Or won to what may work his mter lues,

From whom al! this wa made, all this will noun
Follow, us to him {ink'd iu weal or πως

ln wne them [hut destruction wide vuuy unge t

” To me chau he the glou-y sole among
The* infern-1 ponem, in nne day ιο have mnu-’d
