On man his equal love τ say therefore ους

For 1 that day wan absent, u hesel,

Far on ηοω-εἰσι] toward the getes us hem

Squar'd in full legion (such command we had)

To see that none thence issued forth a epy

Or enemy, while God wan in his ’νοτὶς

Lest he, ineem'd at surh eruption bold,

Destruction with creation might have mix'd.

Not that they durat without his leave “tempu

But us he send» upon his high behesu

The dis-nl gates, and bmiendo'd etronffi

But long ere our apprnnehing, heard within

Torment, and lond lament, and furious nge.

Glad we return'd up to the coasts of light

Ere sabbath-eveniug: se we had in charge.

Pleus'd with thy words un len then thou with mine.»

Is hard³ for who himself beginning knew?

Desire with thee still longer to converse

Indne'd me. As new wak'd from sou-:dest sleep,

Sost on the flowery herb Ι found me laid,

ln hulmy swen3 which with his beams the sun

Suon dried, and on the mking moisture sed.
