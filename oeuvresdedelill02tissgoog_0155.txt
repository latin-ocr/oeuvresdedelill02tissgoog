1⁴4 PARAmsE LOST, B. lx.

Though in mid heaven, soon ended h'u &ligium

And torturus him nov more, the more he sea

fflplensure, not sm· him ordnin'd z then soon

Fierce hate he recollecta, und nll his thoughts

Of mischius, gmtulating, thus excites.
d'houghss, whizher have γε led me l with what swert

Cumpulnion thus mnsponed, to forge:

What hither brought un! haze, mn love3 nor hope

Of paradise for hell, hope here ιο uste

Ofplmm; but ull plasme ιο danway,

Save what is in dmwying3 other joy

To me in lon. Then, let me not lez pass

occasion which now smiles: behold alone

The woman, opportune ιο ull attempts 2

Her husband ( for 1 view sar round) not nigh,

whose higher imessznmnl more 1 shun,

And strength, of oourago haughty aud of limb

lien-oie buius though of mmai mouldz

Foe not insomnii-blo! exmpt from vomd,

1 ιιοις so much hnh hell debns'd, and pain

Enfeebled me, ιο what 1 was iu heaven>

she fair, divinely fair, fit love sor gods !
Not cerrima, though van-or be in love
And beauty, not approach'd by sxronger hate,
