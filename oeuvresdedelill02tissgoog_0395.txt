884 PARADISE LOST, B. ΧΗ.

Men who attend the altu, and should most
Endeamuv peace: their stu-ise pollutior: bring5
Upon the temple* itseii': at lut they seize

The sceptre, and regard not nnvid’s somn
Then lose it ιο ι six-anger, that the true
Anointed king Messiah might be born

Barr'd of his right : yet at his birth a star,
Unseen before in heaven, prochims him (·ouie;
And guides the canem seges, who inquire

nis place, ιο offer incense, myrrh, and gold :
His place of birth a solemn angel tells

To simple shepherds‚ keeping vmch by night3
They gludly thither hest, and by a quire
Ofsqnndron’d angele hear his carol sung.

ι Α virgin in his mother, but his sire
Tho power-'of the Most fligi-3 he shall ascend
The throne herodian-y, and bound his reign

 

With earth'n wide buunds, hin glury with the heavens. n

He oeased, disoeming Adam with such joy
Surcharg'd, as had like grief been dew’d in (ears,

Without the vent os wordsg which these he hreath’d.

ι O prophet of glad tidings, finisher
Os utinum hope! now clear 1 understand

What nst my studies! thoughts have search'd in vainr,

Why our great expectatio„ should be can’d
The seed of woman ι virgin-mother, hail,
fligh in the iove os heuvem yet from my luins
