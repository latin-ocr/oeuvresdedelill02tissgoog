Wh0m‚ un the -ore ω spine, his Mnker rais’d
From dunt z spite then with spite i.- hest repaid. ι

So saying, through each thieket dank or ‹iu-y,
Like a blnck min low-ereeping, he held on
His midm'ghz search, where soonest he might find
The serpent = him fast sleeping soon he found
ln luby'rinth of many a round sels-roll’d,

Not yet in hon-id shnde οι· diuma! den,
Nor nocent yet.- but, on the grunay herb,
Fearlm aufem-’d he slept : in ut his mouth
The devil euter'd; und his brut-11 sense,
ln lpurt οι· head, possessi-ag, soon inspir'd
With net intelligentiah but his sleep
Dinturb’d not, waiting close the approach of muru.

From ὼε emb-'s great altar send up silent pnise
To the Crator, md his nostrils fill
With grateful smell, forth ctme the human pair,
And join’d their vocal worship to the quire
Osa-autum wanting voice; ιΙιιι done, pamke
