A PARADlSE LOST, B. vn.

Remu-n me ιο my nntive element:

Lat from this flying need unrein'd, (as once
Bellerophon, though from ι lower clime¹ )
Dimounted, on ὼε Maian field 1 fall,
Erroneam there ω wmder, and fon-Korn,

Half yet remim unsung but muower bound
Within the visible diumn! sphureg

Stnnding on earth, not rapt above the. pole
More snfe 1 sing with morta! voire, unchnng’ d
To hom-se m· mute, though sall'n ouevss days,
On evil days though fnss’n, and evil ton-guen:
ln ἀει-ᾔτησε, and with dangers compass'dmund,
And solitude; yet not alone, vyhile thou '
Visivst my slurnbers nightly, orwhen morn Ι
Purples the east z still govem thou my so'ng,
Urania, and fit audienoe find, though few.

But drivoe far off the bar-burnus dissonance

Of Bacchus md his revellens, the κω

Os that wild rouo. that tore the Thracian ban!

In Rhodope, where woods and runks had ears
Το raptura, tiu the sange chxnour drowa' d
Both han-p and voice· nm· could the Muse defend
Her son.
