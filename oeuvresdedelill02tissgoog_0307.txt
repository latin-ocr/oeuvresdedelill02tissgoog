:⁷96 PARADJSE LOST, Β. XI.

Os waznhful cherubim : seur faces euch
aad, like a double Jnnnsz all their slnpe
Spangled with eyes more numerous'than those
Of Argus, and mo're wakesul than to drowse,
ohanna with Arcadian pipe, me paglorax read
Of Hermes, or his opi-ate rod.

Meanwhile,
To rfflaluoe the world with sacred light,
Leucothea vak’d, aud with fresh dews emhulm'd
The earth: when Adam and first nuatum Eve
fiad ended now their orimus, and found “
Strength added from above; new hope tu spring
Out of despair ς joy, but with sear yet link‘d:
Which thus ιο Eve his welca-ne words renew’d :

ι Eve, easily may faith udn1it,.that all
The good which we enjoy from heaven descends;
But, that from us aught should ascend to heaven
So prevalent as ιο concern the mind
Os God high-blest, m· ιο incline his will,
Hard to believe may seem.- yet this will prayer
Or one short sigh oflnunan breath, uphorne
Even to the seat os Godss ¹For since l wught
By prayer the' offended Deity ω’ appense,
Kueel'd, and before him humbled all my heartz
Methought 1 saw him placabit and mild,
Bending his ean persuasion in me grew,
Thu 1 was heard with savona peace reu-rn’d

Home ιο my brem, and to my menum-y
