224 PARADlSE LOST, Β, λ.

So saying, with deligln he snuss'd the smel!
Of mortal change on earth* As when ι ssoek
Of ravenous fowl, though many ι league remote,
Against the day of battler ω a field
Where armies lie encampfl, cum flying, lur'd
With ‘soem of living can-casses, design’d
For death the following ὼγ, in binody flght:
So sceuted the grim feature, and upturn'd
His nostril wide into the tnurky air,
Sagacious of his qum-ry from so far.

Then bom from out bess-gata, into the waste
Wide anarchy os chaos damp und dark,
Flew diverse ; and with power (their power was great)
Hovering upon the waters, what they met
Solid or sliu-y, as iu raging sea
Tosl up and down, together crowded drove,
From each side shoaling towards the mouth of hell z
As when to polar wiuds, blowing ndvzrse ’
Upon the emmau sen, together drive
Moumains οἲ ioe, that stop the imagin'd way
Beyond Peuma eastward, to the rich
Cathaian coast.

The aggregatae! soil
Death with his mace pen-ilic, culd and dsy,
As with a trident, επιουες aud fix‘d as firm
As Delos, floating once ι the rest his look
Bound with Gorgouian rigour not to movet
And‘with Asphaltic slime, broad as the gule,
