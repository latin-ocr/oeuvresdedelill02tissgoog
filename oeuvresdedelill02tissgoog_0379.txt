368 PARADISE LOST, Β. ΧΠ,

(Whom faithful Abraham due u'me shall call )
A wn, und of his son a grand-child, leaves3
Like him in saith, in wisdom, and renowm

Γ ι The grand-child, with zwelve sons encrens'd, departs

From Cannam, ιο a land hereaster cass'd

See where it fluws, disgorging at seven mouths
Into the sea τ ιο sojourn in dut land

Rnise him ιο he the second in that malm

Growing into a nntium und, now grown,
Suspected ιο a sequent king, who seeks

To stop their overgrowth, as inmnte guests

Inhospitably‚ and kills their infant males:

Til! by two brethren( these two hrethren eall
Muses and Aaron ) sent from God ιο claim

His people from enthralmem, they retum
With glory' and spuil, back ιο their promis’d [and.

To know thei·- God, or moesage to regard,
Must be compell’d by signs aud judgments dire3
To blood unshed the rivers must be turn·d;
Frogs, lice, and ffies, must all his palaoe fill
With loach'd inu-usion, and fill ull the land5

nis cattle must os rot and mul-rain die:
Bonches and blusns must all his flesh ambesa,
