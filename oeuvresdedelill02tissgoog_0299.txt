288 PARADISE LOST, B. ΧΙ.
Flew up, nor mim'd the way, by envious winde
Bluwn vugebnud or frustum ε in they pase'd
Dimensionlesu through heavenly door-n then clad
With inmense, where the golden altar sum'd,
By their great Intercessor, came in sight
Before the rathen-’s threnn thern the glad Son
Presenting, thus to intercede began z

α See, Far-her, what first-frum on earth ure sprung
From thy implanted grace in man: these sighs
And pnyers, which in this golden censer, mix'd
With incense, 1 thy priest before thee hringz
Fmits uf more ple-sing snvour, froin thy seed
Sown with contritioni in his beart, thau those
Which, his own lund manuring, nu the trees
Of paradise could have produe'd, ere fall'n
From innoeence. Now «heresem, bend chine ear
'ro supplicatiom henr his sighs, though mutu
Unskilflss with what words to pray, lez me
Interpret ior him3 rue, his advocate
And propitiatiom au his works ou me,
Good, or not good, iugi-asu my merit those
Shnll perfect, und ror these my death shall pay.
Accept me: und in me, from these receive
The smell οξ ρεεοε townrd mmkiud: let him live
Before thee reeoneil'd, nt least his days
Numher'd, though aad: till duih, his doum, (whichl
To mitignte thus plead. not tu revene,)
To better life shall yie’ld him; where with me
All my redeem'd may dwell injoy and bliss3
