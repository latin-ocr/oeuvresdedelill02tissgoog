178 . PARADISE LOST, B. lx.
From his nlaok band the gan-lund wreath’d for Eve
Down dropt, md all thn sudet! rosea §hed ε

Speeehless he stood und pale, u'ss thus at length
First to himselft ha inward sssence broke-

ι 0 fab-est of oration, last und best

Of ull Gud’s ποτὶ», creature in whom exoell'd
whatever mn to sight or thought he sorm'd,
lioly, divine, good, amiuble, οι· sweet!
How nn thou lost! how on a sudden lost,
nemu, dessower'd, and now to death devote!
Rudzer, how hest thou yielded to transgress
The strict forbiddance, how to violate
Tho sacred fruit snrbidd'n? some cun-sed fraud
Of enemy¹ bath heguil'd thee, yet unknown,
And une with thee bath ruin'd: for with thee
Germia my resolution is ιο die t
How can Ι live without thee! how for-ego

Ι Thy sweet converse, und luvew dem-ly join'd,
To live again in these wild woods fou-lom!
Should God create another Eve, and l
Another rib εἶξαι-ἀ, yet loss of thee
Would never from my hen-tx no, no! Ι feel
The link of nature dnw me: flesh os ssenh,
Bone ofmy bone thou un, and from thy state
Mine never shall he parte-⁴1, blissnr wne. ι
