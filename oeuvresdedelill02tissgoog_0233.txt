Wiugs growing, and dominion given me large

Beyond this daem whatever dnus me on,

Or sympathy, or some connatural force,

Porci-ful at greatest distance to unite‚'

With secret amity, things of like kind,

By secreust oonveynuce. Thou, my shade

For death from sin no power ean sepul-ne<

But, lest the difficulty· of pnssing back

Stay his retum perhaps over this guls

(Adventui-ons work! yet ιο thy power and mine

Not unugreeable, ) ιο found a path

Over this mein, from hell to that new world

Where Satan now prevails: n monument

Of merit high to au the' insen-nal host,

Euning :heir passage hence, sor intereunt-se,

Or transmigratiom us their lot shnll lead.

Nor ean 1 miss the way, so strongly drawn

By this new-felt atti-aetion and instinct. ι

The way, thou leading; such a went 1 dmw
