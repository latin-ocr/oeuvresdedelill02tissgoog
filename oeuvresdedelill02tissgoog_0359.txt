348 PARADISE LOST, B. XI. ,

Shall, with their freedom lost, all virtue lose
And sear ns God3 from whom their piety feign‘tl
ln sharp contest os battle found no nid

Against invadam therefore, cool'd in καί,
Thencesorth shall praemise how ιο live secure,
Worldly or dissolute, ou what their lon-ds

Shall leave them to enjoy; ( for the' earth shall bear
More than enough, that zemperanee may be tried z )
So all shall turn degenerata, all deprav'd;
Justiee and temperante. trum and saith, fol-got ς
One man except, the only son ns light

ln a dan-k nge, against exnmplz good,

Against mammem, emtum. and a world
Offended3 fearless of reproach and seorn

Or violence, he uf their wicked ways

Shall them admonish3 and before them set

The pazhs of righoenumoss, how much more sare,
And sull of pezo& denomcing wrath to cume
On their impeniteneez and shall return

Of them derided : but os God observ’d

The nne just man alive, by his command,

Shall build a wondrous ark, ( as thou beheld'st )
To save himself and household, from :mida

Α world devote w universal wruck.

Nu sooner he, with them us mun und beast
Select for life, shall iu the ark he lodg'd,

And shelter'd round, but all the cataracta,

Os heaven, set open, on the earth shall pour
Rain, day and night: all founmins of the deep,
