126 PARADJSE LOST, B. lx.
To whom mild auswer Adam thus retum'd z

ι Sole Eve, associate sole, to me beyond
Compare above al! living ereatures dear l
Well hzst thou motinn¹d, well thy thoughts amplos-i,
How we might best fulffl the work which here
God hnth assign'd us; nor os me shnlt pass
Unprais'd: for nothing lovelier ean be found
ln woman, than to sundy household good,
And good works in her husband to promote*
Yet not so strictly hah our Lord impos'd
thour, as to deber us when we need
Resreshment‚ whether sood, or talk between,
(Food os the mind) or this sweet intercourse
Os looks and smilesz fur smiles from reason flow,
To brute denied, and are os love the food3
Luve, not zhe lowest end of human lise.
For not to irkwme toil, but to delight,
He made ιιι, md delight to reason join'd.
These pnhs and bowers doubt not but our joint hands
Will keep from wildemess with ense, ns wide

- As we need wulk, tin younger hands ere long
Auis: us = but, ic much converse perhaps
Thee satiate, to short absence 1 could yield t
For solitude sometimes is best society,
And short retirement urges sweet return⁴
But other doubt possessee me, lest harm
sesan thee, πνοι-’ἀ from me: sor thou know'st
What hath been warn’d us, us what mlicious soe
Envying our happiness, and of his own
