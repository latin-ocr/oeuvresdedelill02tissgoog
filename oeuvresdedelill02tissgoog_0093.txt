82 PARADlSE LOST, Β. VHL

Shalz lose, expess'd from henos imo ι world
Os woe and son-ow. ι - stemly he pronounc'd
The rigid imm-diction, whiehjmunds

Yet dreadful iu nune eur, though in my ehoie‘e
Not to incur-5 but mun his clear aspect
Remu-dd, and gracious purpqee thus renewu.

ι Not only these sair bound-s, but all the anth
To thee and to thy tace 1 give z as lurda
Possess it, and all things that therein live,

Or live iu mor ain beust, flsh, und fowl.

ln sign whereof, each hini and beust behold
After their kinds; 1 bring them ιο receive
From thee their names, und pay thee feahy
With low subjection ι understand the same

05 [ish within their wat¹ry resideneey

Not hither uununon'd, sinoe they cannot change
Their clement, ῑο draw the thinner nir. ιν -

Aa thus he spalte, each bird und beust behold
Appruaching two tud two: these cowering low
With blandishmem τ each bird stonp'd on his ring.
1 nam'd them, ns they pass'd, and understood
Their ιιίῑιιης with such knowledge God endued
My sudden apprehensiom but in these
1 found not what methought 1 wanted still:

And to the heaveuly Vision thus presuni'd. —

ι 0, hy what name, for Thou above all these,
Abnve mankind, or aughz than mankind bigher,
Sul-passast sar my numium how may 1
Adoro thee, Author uf this universe,
