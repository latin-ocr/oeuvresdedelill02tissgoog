:37⁸ PARAmSE LOST, B. xn.

His day, in whom all nntium shall be hlest z

Favour numer-itud by me, who sought

Forbidden knowledge by fnssbidden umam.

Thy yet 1 appi-cheud not, why ιο those,

Aniong whom God will daiga to dwell on earth,

So many and so various lnws are given„

So many lawe urg-ie so mmy sins

Among theim how can God with such reside? ι
Το whom thus Michael ι ι Duubt not but that sin

Will reign among them, as of thee hegen

And therefore ’νυ lnw given them m evinco

Their natural privaty, by stin-ring up

Sin against law ιο fight3 that when they me

Law nan disoover sin, but not remove,

, Save by those sludowy expintiom weflk,

The blood of hull and goats, they may conclude

Some blood more previous must he paid fur man:

Just sor unjufltq that, in such righwousness

To §.hm by saith impuoed, they mny find

sustinendan wwardfl God, and puae

Of comcience; which the lnw by ceremonias

Cannot nppeaseq nor num the moral part

Persam: and, not pei-forming, cannot live.

So law uppem-s imperfecz3 md huz given

With purpose to reeign them, in full time,

Up to ι better novenum: disciplina

From uhndowy types to ιτιιὼς from flesh ω spiriu

From impositiou of strict lawa to free

Acoepmuce of lau-gn graoe3 from servile feni·
