332 PARADISE LOST, B. XI.
Hymen, then first ιο waninge-nites invok'd :
With feast aud music all the tenu remund-
Such happy interview, and fair event
Of love and youth not lost, songs, garlnnds, flowers,
And char-ming symphonies, amch’d the hem
Of Adam, soon inclin'd ω’ admit delighe,
The bent os nnture z which he thus express'd :

u True opener of mine eyes, prime angel mest:
Munh better seems this vision, and nmre hope
Of peaceful days pomuds ‚ than those two pam
These were of hate and death, or pain much wome3
Here nature seems fulfill’d in all her ends. ι

Το whom thus Michaelz ι Judge not what is best
By pleasure, though ιο nature wernsing meon
Creuzed, as thou art, ω nohler end,

Holy and pure, confurmity divine*

Those tems thou saw'st so phuam, were the tenu
Of wiekedness, when-uin shall dwell his tace

Who slew his brother ι studious they appear

Os artu that polish life, inv'entors rnre:

Umnindful of their Mnker, though his spirit
Tuught them: but they his gifts acknowledg’d none.
Yet they a heauteous offspring skal! beget3

For that fair female ποορ thou saw'st,t}mt seem’d
Of goddesses, so blidue, so sunooth, so guy,

Yet empty of ull good vherein eonsism

Woman'n domestic honour und chief pruine3
