206 PARADISE LOST, Β. Χ.

Enemal Father, from his secret cloud
Amidsz, in thumim· utter'd thus his voice:

α Aseembled angels, and γε powers retum’d
From unsuecesssul charge3 be not dismay'd,
Nor troubled at these tidings from the earth,
Which your sinceres: care couhi not preven23
Forenold so lately what would come to pass,
When first this temptem· cross’d the gulf from hell.
l told ye then, ye should prevail, and speed
On his bad errand5 man should be seduc'd,
And flatter’d out of au, believing lies
Against his Maka-3 no dem-ee os mine
Commu-ing ιο necessitate his fau,
Or touch with lightest moment os impulse
His free will, ω her own inelining lest
ln even scale- But sall'u he ἑᾶς und now
What rests, but that the mortu] sentence pass
On his transgremion, death denounc’d that day?
Which he proeumes alre-dy vain md void,
Because not yet inmensi, as he feu'd,
By some immediate stroke3 but soon shall find
Fon-heumann no aoquizmnee, ere day end*
,Iustiee shall not return as bounty scm-n'd⁴
But whom send 1 ιο judge theu-‘2' whom but thee,
vicegerem Son? to thee Ι have transcen-’d
All judgmem, whether in heaven, or earth, ur heu.
Easy iz may he seen that 1 intend
Mercy nolleague with jusu'oe, sending thee
Man‘s friend, his mediator, his desigu'd
