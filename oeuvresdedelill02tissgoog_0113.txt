102 PARADISE LOST, B. Vlll.

And sweet oomplinnoe, which deciate unfeign'd
Union of mind, or in us both one seul:

Harmouy to behold in wedded pair,

More grateful‘than harmoniam souud to the' eur,
Yet these subject not: 1 to thee disclusa

What iuwurd thence 1 feel, not therefore soil'd,
Who meet with various objects, smm the sense
Variously representing: yet, still free,

Approve the best, and follow what 1 appr-ove.

Tu love, thou biam’st me non for love, thou sny'st,
Lenda up tn heaven, is both the way and gamm
Beer with me than, is nwful wint l uk:

bove not «he heavenly spirits, and how their love
Express they? hy looks only? or do they mix
lrndiance, virtuai or immediate touch? ιι

To whom the angel, with a smiie that glow’d
Celestial rosy red, love's proper hue,
Answer’d: . laet iz suffice thee that thou know'st
Us happy, and without love no happiness.
Whatever pure thou in the body enjoy'st,
(And pure thou wert created) we enjoy
ln eminenmu and obstacle find none
Of membrane, joint, ur limi», exclusive baim
Easier than air with aii·y if spirits embrace,
Tutal they mix, union os pure with piu-e
